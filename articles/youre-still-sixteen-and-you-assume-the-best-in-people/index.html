<p>This is why I love Quora &#x2013; questions like this. Questions that make you go, I&#x2019;ve wondered the same thing too!. And when you read the answers, you don&#x2019;t just satisfy your itch, get entertained, but you also learn a whole lot!</p>

<p>I really love the Joker quotes in the top answer (as of today). After reading a few, I came up with my own answer too. This is a quote not from a movie, but a TV show. However, I thought it is still worth mentioning. It spoke to my heart when I first heard it more than two years ago, it still resonates with me now and gives me chills every time I listen to it.</p>

<p>(I wish there was a better quality video).</p>

Hey! What did you just call him? You use that word, you&#x2019;re talking about him. Yeah that&#x2019;s because you&#x2019;re still sixteen and you assume the best in people. You live a few years, you start seeing the hate in people&#x2019;s hearts. Even the best people. You use the &#x2018;N&#x2019; word? How about &#x201C;retard&#x201D;? You call that nice girl on the Cheerios with Kurt a retard? But you think it&#x2019;s okay to come into my house and say faggy? I know what you meant! You think I didn&#x2019;t use that word when I was your age? Some kid gets clocked in practice, we&#x2019;d tell him to stop being such a fag: shake it off. We meant it exactly the way that you meant it: that being gay is wrong, that it&#x2019;s some kind of punishable offence. I really thought you were different Finn. I thought that being in glee club and being raised by your mom, meant that you were some new generation of dude who saw things differently- you just kind of came into the world knowing what it&#x2019;s taken me years of struggling to figure out. I guess I was wrong; I&#x2019;m sorry Finn but you can&#x2019;t stay here, I love your mom and maybe this is gonna cost me her, but my family comes first and I can&#x2019;t have that kind of poison around. This is our home, Kurt. He is my son. Out in the world you do what you want. but not under my roof.
