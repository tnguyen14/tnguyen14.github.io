			<h1>Introducing Tobiko</h1>
			<div class="article-date">11-17-2014</div>
<p>About a year and a half ago, amidst the hype of static sites, I attempted to convert my WordPress blog over to a static blog. The advantages were clear to me as a developer: much faster performance, authoring in markdown, source-controlled content out of the box, easy and free hosting with Github Pages, and the list goes on. This was the motivation for <a href="https://github.com/tnguyen14/tobiko">tobiko</a>, a Grunt-based static site generator &#x2013; a tool I wrote that I thought would be useful for other developers out there.</p>
<h3>Existing static site generators</h3>
<p>The path to tobiko where it is today was not always straight forward however. I did not want to reinvent the wheels initially, and tried out a few different static site generators out there.</p>
<p>I began with the obvious choice &#x2013; Octopress powered by Jekyll. There was (and still is) a lot of enthusiasm about Jekyll in the open source community, and I believe that is so for good reasons. However, at this time period, I started to write a lot more JavaScript in the browser as well as node, and for some reason Ruby and its tool chain never really clicked for me. I had a lot of issues setting Octopress up and deploying properly, most likely due to my own shortcoming, despite having taken an intro to Ruby course on Codeacademy a few months prior.</p>
<p>As node was already a huge and growing community back then, there were a few contenders of static site generator written in node as well. Most notably was <a href="http://wintersmith.io/">wintersmith</a>, which I thought was very cool. I tried it out and even wrote <a href="https://github.com/tnguyen14/wintersmith-handlebars">a plugin</a> for it. Nonetheless, I ended up parting ways with wintersmith as well. The tool was authored mostly in Coffeescript, which did not appeal to me, and the whole plugin architecture seemed confusing.</p>
<h3>Grunt &#x2013; a proven build tool</h3>
<p>At the same time, Grunt was quickly becoming very popular as a mainstream build tool with a great community around it. And I thought the whole idea of a static site generator fits in very well with a build tool ecosystem. So I created <a href="https://github.com/tnguyen14/tobiko">tobiko</a> &#x2013; a Grunt-based static site generator.</p>
<h3>Main features</h3>
<p>I wanted tobiko to be based on a stack that I would like to work with. Here are a few highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>tobiko itself is a glorified grunt plugin, which features 2 main task &#x2013; parsing content and generating html pages.</li>
<li>Content can be written in either Markdown (with YAML frontmatter) or JSON.</li>
<li>Templates are written in Handlebars by default.</li>
<li>Styles are written in SCSS by default.</li>
<li>JavaScript uses RequireJS to support AMD syntax.</li>
<li>Site and project configurations are stored in JSON files that can be overwritten based on the environment (<code>dev</code> vs <code>prod</code>).</li>
<li>Content can be nested indefinitely in the traditional file system. HTML pages reflect that nesting structure. That path however can be overwritten as desired.</li>
<li>Pagination and archives.</li>
<li>Image compression with responsive image support by generating multiple image resolutions on build.</li>
<li>Deployment to Github Pages or any static server with <code>rsync</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Yeoman generator</h3>
<p>If these features are enough to intrigue you, I&#x2019;d encourage you to try tobiko out. I&#x2019;ve also written a <a href="https://github.com/tnguyen14/generator-tobiko">Yeoman generator</a> for tobiko, so that you can set up all the directory structure and grunt tasks within a minute or two. The whole idea is to scaffold and deploy a simple static site within a matter of minutes.</p>
<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<p>I have used tobiko to create a few sites so far with very satisfying results. I think that something like tobiko can be very useful for a simple business site, personal blog or even a style guide for larger projects. It is definitely meant for developers who know their way around code and JavaScript, and who enjoy writing content in Markdown.</p>
<p>In the course of using tobiko, I have found a few areas for improvement as well as possible ways to expand the project. Here are some ideas of what I&#x2019;d like to do with it next (without selling too much vaporware):</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a gulp-based version. File systems are great, but streams can speed up the build process many times over.</li>
<li>Add more tests to make the tasks more stable.</li>
<li>Support for browserify/ CommonJS syntax for JavaScript.</li>
<li>Support for other templating engines.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you take a look at tobiko (which is by itself pretty simple) and think you can help out with these items, please feel free to file an issue or send a pull request.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading this far, and if I&#x2019;ve got you somewhat convinced, definitely give <a href="https://github.com/tnguyen14/tobiko">tobiko</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tnguyen14/generator-tobiko">generator-tobiko</a> a try!</p>
